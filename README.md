# Code Refactor Starter Code

Refactor notes:
    1: First I there was very many instances of classes in the html in elements that can just simply just be converted to semantic, like ".footer" and ".header".
    2: There where a few instances of other elements I made semantic, like the "nav" and "aside" elements
    3: Corrected a few instances of redundant code in the CSS file, like with the "aside" section.
    4: Fixed the "hero" element to make the image exsist within the html so an alt tag can exsist for accessebility.
    5: Made alt tags for all substancial images displayed.
